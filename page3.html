      My goal for web design is just to make my personal website. For this
      intro-level class my goal is to learn as much as I can about every aspect
      of web design.

      I had prior experience with programming with java and c#. I made other
      projects before that involved the usage of CSS.

      I have a laptop and a desktop both are sufficient for making web pages. I
      am a Tisch BFA, so the department also gives us access to free adobe
      software.
