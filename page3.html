      </li>
      My goal for web design is just to make my personal website. For this
      intro-level class my goal is to learn as much as I can about every aspect
      of web design.
      <br />

      <li><b>Which aspects of web design interest you the most?</b></li>
      I am interested in the interface design aspect most.<br />

          >What current skills do you have that will be useful in creating web
          pages?</b
        >
      </li>
      I had prior experience with programming with java and c#. I made other
      projects before that involved the usage of CSS.
      <br />
      <li><b>Which skills will you need to brush up on?</b></li>
      I want to get more familiar with graphic design tools like photoshop.

          >Which hardware and software tools do you already have for web
          design?</b
        >
      </li>
      I have a laptop and a desktop both are sufficient for making web pages. I
      am a Tisch BFA, so the department also gives us access to free adobe
      software.

        <b
          >Which tools do you need to buy? Which tools would you like to buy
          eventually?</b
        >
      </li>
      I think I have everything needed to make web pages.
